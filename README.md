# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System
Heart disease is one of the most significant causes of mortality in todayâ€™s world. As heart disease prediction is a complex task, there is a need to automate the prediction process to avoid risks associated with it and alert the patient well in advance.Machine learning has been shown to be effective assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the health care industry.We used two popular machine learning algorithms and classifiers performance evaluation metrics such as classification accuracy, correlation coefficient.
